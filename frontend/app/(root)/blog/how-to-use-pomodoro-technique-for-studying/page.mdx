## What Is the Pomodoro Technique?  

Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique involves working in **25-minute focused sessions** followed by short breaks. After four sessions, you take a longer break.

### The Classic Pomodoro Cycle:  
1. **25 minutes** of focused study  
2. **5-minute** break  
3. Repeat 4 times  
4. After the 4th cycle, take a **15–30 minute** break  

This rhythm prevents burnout and keeps your mind fresh and focused.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using Pomodoro to Study Smarter  

### 1. Set a Study Goal  
Define what you’ll focus on during your next Pomodoro. Make it specific:  
- ✅ "Summarize Chapter 3" instead of ❌ "Study biology"

### 2. Use a Timer (Digital or Physical)  
Use your phone, a dedicated app, or a physical timer. Popular Pomodoro apps include:  
- **Forest**  
- **Focus Keeper**  
- **Pomofocus**  

### 3. Work Without Distractions  
Put your phone on silent. Close unnecessary tabs. Let others know you’re in a session.

### 4. Take Real Breaks  
During your 5-minute breaks:  
- Walk  
- Stretch  
- Drink water  
Avoid scrolling or multitasking — it resets your focus.

### 5. Track Your Pomodoros  
Log how many Pomodoros you completed. This helps build awareness and motivation.

## When to Use Longer or Shorter Pomodoros  

While 25/5 is the default, some students find variations helpful:  
- **50/10**: For deep work sessions  
- **15/3**: For high-stress days or difficult topics  

Experiment to find what suits your energy and focus levels.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid  

❌ **Ignoring Breaks**: Skipping rest can lead to burnout.  
❌ **Multitasking**: Only one task per Pomodoro.  
❌ **Not Planning Ahead**: Always know your next goal before starting the timer.
